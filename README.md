# Stellar Lords

by Alain Felger, 2024

## Introduction

Stellar Lords is a clone of the 1993 Classic "Stellar Empires", althought some core concepts are different.
The Game had some impact on my childhood and I wanted to try out game development with raylib

## Disclaimer

This is the first game in some years I tried to create.
Currently, not much is functional.
